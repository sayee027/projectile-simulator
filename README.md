# 🎯 Projectile Motion Simulator with Drag and Energy Analysis

A comprehensive Streamlit app for simulating projectile motion with air drag, energy analysis, and validation against real-world data. Designed for students, researchers, and physics enthusiasts, this tool allows interactive exploration of projectile trajectories with customizable parameters and real-time plots.

## 🚀 Features
- **📈 3D and 2D Visualization** of projectile motion
- **🌬️ Air Drag Models** (Constant, Velocity-Dependent, Altitude-Dependent)
- **🔋 Energy Analysis** (Kinetic, Potential, and Total Energy)
- **🧪 Research Validation Tab** to compare simulation data with experimental results
- **🔄 Real-Time Updates** with user-controlled sliders and inputs
- **📦 Modular Code Design** with separate functions for physics modeling, plotting, and UI

## 🧠 Background
This app is part of a physics research project:
"Experimental and Theoretical Analysis of Projectile Motion Using a DIY Launcher"

It bridges physics theory with practical experimentation, combining simulation, energy conservation, and drag dynamics into an educational tool.

## 🛠️ To-Do
 Add export options (CSV, PDF)
 Include wind resistance and turbulence effects
 Support for different projectile shapes (football, arrows)
 Integration with real experimental datasets
